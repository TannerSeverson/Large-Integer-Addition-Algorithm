# Large-Integer-Addition-Algorithm


/* README:
 Algorithm for adding large numbers by using an array containing single integers
 
 Example:
 let arrayOfNumber1 = [9, 7, 7, 2, 2] // Number 1 = 97,722
 let arrayOfNumber2 = [4, 3, 9, 2, 4] // Number 2 = 43,924
 
 ..97,722
 + 43,924
 --------
 .141,646
 
 Output should equal [1, 4, 1, 6, 4, 6]
